## How to use:
Our whole Mom & Pop ecommerce application is functionally running on the link provided in our “links” file in our submission folder. 
Found here: https://mnp-ecom-2020.azurewebsites.net/#/

Download the code from the GitHub, to run the code open the folder ‘client’ in terminal and execute the following commands:

1. First run the Spring Boot application on visual studio code

2. Run the following command on your terminal to download and install neccessary packages

```yarn ```

3. The next command is ran to fix formatting on windows (Lf format for windows and crlf on linux)

```yarn lint```

4. The last command is ran to compile the client

```yarn serve```

This runs the server locally on localhost although it is identical to the running web server hosted on azure previously mentioned.
